🐍 Beginner Python Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-level Python mini-projects! 👋  
These small projects helped me practice basic concepts like variables, lists, dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and user input.

 📚 What's Inside

This repo includes 4 simple Python programs:

1. 📘 Student Record Management System**  
   Add, view, update, and delete student records using a simple menu-based system.

2. 🛒 Grocery Billing System**  
   Add items to your cart, view the list, and calculate the total bill — like a mini shopping cart.

3. 📞 Phone Book System**  
   Save contacts with names and numbers. You can also view and search contacts by name.

4. 📋 To-Do List App**  
   Add tasks, mark them as done, view your list, and delete completed tasks — simple and clean.

🛠️ Requirements

Just make sure you have ""Python 3"" installed. No external libraries are needed!
